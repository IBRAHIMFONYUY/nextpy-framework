* Static site generation (SSG)
* API routes
* React-style hooks in Python
* Built-in AI coding assistant
* Modern CLI tooling
* Enterprise-ready architecture

## Why NextPy?

### Python First

Build full-stack applications without switching languages.

### PSX

Write component-based user interfaces using NextPy's Python Syntax Extension.

### AI Native

NextPy includes an integrated AI coding assistant:

```bash
nextpy ai
```

Chat mode:

```bash
nextpy ai chatbot
```

Agent mode:

```bash
nextpy ai agent
```

Generate complete applications:

```bash
nextpy ai create ecommerce app
```

from nextpy import interactive_component as component, useState, create_onclick

@component
def Home():
    [count, setCount] = useState(0)

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Welcome to NextPy</h1>

            <button create_onclick={create_onclick(lambda e: setCount(count + 1))}>
                Count: {count}
            </button>
        </div>
